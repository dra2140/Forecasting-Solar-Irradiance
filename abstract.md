# Abstract

This research project proposes a spatiotemporal analysis of solar energy data for regions with substantial solar energy development, focusing on either key US states (California, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada) or high-potential areas in the Middle East and South Asia. This study aims to analyze Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) from solar radiation datasets (National Solar Radiation Database(NSRDB)) by applying various ML/DL methods (MLP, LSTM, SVR) and forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA). I plan on conducting three time-scales (monthly, weekly, and daily) to evaluate which methods work best in different regions and time-scales. The project outcomes would ideally provide further insights into solar energy grid integration and may help identify optimal forecasting strategies for different geographical contexts.
